# CSGO4broadcast_Gamestate_to_CSV

This project is designed to be an interface between the CSGO GSI and a simple data structure that can be pulled by broadcast CG software. 

 This is a work in progress - There is poor exception checking while parsing JSON data from the API (so missing entries will except), and there is a fair amount of hangover code from the previous project.
